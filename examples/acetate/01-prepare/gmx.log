NOTE 1 [file system-02.top, line 149]:
  System has non-zero total charge: 0.600000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  https://manual.gromacs.org/current/user-guide/floating-point.html
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.




WARNING 1 [file system-02.top, line 149]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.

NOTE 2 [file /home/vojta/code/BayesicForceFields/bff/data/mdp/nvt.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.


NOTE 3 [file /home/vojta/code/BayesicForceFields/bff/data/mdp/nvt.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
