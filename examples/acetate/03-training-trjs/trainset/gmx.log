NOTE 2 [file /home/vojta/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/nvt-000.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.


NOTE 3 [file /home/vojta/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/nvt-000.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.

NOTE 3 [file /home/vojta/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/em.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.

  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded

NOTE 2 [file /home/vojta/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/nvt-001.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.

  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.

NOTE 3 [file /home/vojta/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/em.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.
