  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can

  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.

NOTE 3 [file /home/vojta/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/em.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
