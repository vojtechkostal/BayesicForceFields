NOTE 2 [file /home2/kostal/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/nvt-000.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.


NOTE 3 [file /home2/kostal/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/nvt-000.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.

WARNING 1 [file md-14-000.top, line 137]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.


NOTE 2 [file md-15-000.top, line 137]:
  System has non-zero total charge: -0.800000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.

  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy

  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.

  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy

  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 783.00

NOTE 2 [file /home2/kostal/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/nvt-000.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.


NOTE 3 [file /home2/kostal/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/nvt-000.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.

  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is

  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded

  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is

NOTE 3 [file /home2/kostal/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/em.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.

WARNING 1 [file md-02-002.top, line 149]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.

NOTE 3 [file /home2/kostal/code/BayesicForceFields/examples/acetate/01-prepare/train/em.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.

  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
